# Encoding
This Repository is based on encryption tools or scripts, en_decode python file is based on introducing encryption technique of ROT-13 Algorithm
I will introduce more python scripts that will present more Encryption algorithms and if you also want to contribute to this Encoding Project then I would be delighted to have you on this project.

# Introduction of ROT-13
Rot-13 (short for Rotation 13) is the name given to a mono-alphabetical substitution cipher which has the property of being reversible and very simple.

Combining the French/Latin alphabet of 26 letters and an offset of 13, Rot-13 replaces a letter with another located thirteen places further down the alphabet.

Rot-13 coding is popular to hide content because it is easily reversible, indeed, if it is applied twice, then the original message reappears.

# Using en_decode.py
Its simple, run it with python and the program will ask for your input, submit your input and then 
you won't be able to read your message after the encryption.
